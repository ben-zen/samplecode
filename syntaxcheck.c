/* Simple syntax checker in C.  Checks for open parentheses, brackets, braces,

 * use of semicolons or any other language feature, so just because this program
 * returns a positive result for your code does *not* mean it will compile ;)

/* So far, my method of attack for this is to consider comments independently of
 * other enclosures, since you can't use a single char to represent to capture
 * its opening or closing marks; as such, there will be a recursive function to
 * determine if a set of enclosing symbols is unbounded or no; if it is properly
 * bounded, it returns 0, but if it is not, it returns 1. This can work quite
 * simply by having a state in each level of the recursion; you can have it as
 * an integer state set initially as 0, and if at any point an EOF is reached
 * *outside* of the main function, set the failure_state at 1 and break the
 * while() loop, thus causing a return of a failing condition; OR this together
 * with the calling function's failure_state, and voil√† it's a test. I don't
 * particularly feel like writing it to also handle returning details about the
 * error, but it'd definitely be possible. I feel like I'd need to have it
 * return a struct in that case, but I can rewrite it to be more complete later.
 *
 * If this were C++, I'd have it construct a string as an exception and throw
 * it.
