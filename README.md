samplecode
==========

Mostly C and C++ code, generally under GPLv3+ or other free licenses.  The code
here will be general solutions either to commonly-posed problems (such as
fizz-buzz) or solutions to problems out of the ANSI edition of K&R; others might
be because I wanted to work on a specific basic task, before tackling something
more difficult.  In short, welcome to my playground.
